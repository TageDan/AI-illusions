# AI illusions

## Inspirations
I first encountered this method in a [youtube-video about puzzels with two distinct solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU) by [Matt Parker](https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths) and [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould). I then looked into one of the papers mentioned and watch some videos on the authors youtube channel wich mentioned another similiar paper. These are the two papers that I will look into and use to experiment with:
- [Visual Anagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17919)
- [Diffusion Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03817)

## Goals
My goal is to understand and create these illusions myself. I would also like to experiment with other types of illusions that can be created using the same method. I would like to create a application/website and/or framework/api to create these illusions and it would also be intresting to try and build some physical versions of these illusions.
