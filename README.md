# AI illusions

## Inspirations
I first encountered this method in a [youtube-video about puzzels with two distinct solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU) by [Matt Parker](https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths) and [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould). I then looked into one of the papers mentioned and watch some videos on the authors youtube channel wich mentioned another similiar paper.


## Resources
- [Fourier Feature Networks]https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10739
- [Visual Anagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17919)
- [Diffusion Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03817)

## Goals
My goal is to understand and create these illusions myself. I would also like to experiment with other types of illusions that can be created using the same method. I would like to create a application/website and/or framework/api to create these illusions and it would also be intresting to try and build some physical versions of these illusions.

## project outline and timeline
I will list the steps required for reaching my goals. The time estimates will be really rough since there will be a lot of experimentation as well.

- Create a module for the Fourier Feature Networks (2-4 weeks)
- Setup a pretrained diffusion model to get the estimated noise given a prompt (1-2 weeks)
- Setup the training-pipeline for the illusions (3-6 weeks)
- Experiment with how suitible different arrangments are for the creation of illusions, both physical ones and digitally, what prompts seem to work and what formats would be interesting to showcase / (what gives the most suprising and nice looking illusions) (2-4 weeks / can be parallel with further development)
- Make physical examples. (1-2 weeks)
- Write my report
